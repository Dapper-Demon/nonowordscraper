# Come on RGL, this literally took me an hour to make

## A logs.tf scraper to check chat for no no words

### How to use:
1) Add any steam ID's that you want to scrape into ids.txt with the format of steamID64 [steam3ID]
2) Add any no no words that you do not like into badwords.txt with a space in between them
3) Run the damn thing

As of right now this program only searches through the last 20 logs of each player. Since logs.tf
has a date on every log you can focus your search onto specific times of the day. Like if you want
to only search within an hour of normal scrim times. But, RGL can handle that, I don't work for them.
